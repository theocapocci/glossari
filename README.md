Glossari is intended to be a browser extension designed to assist vocabulary acquisition by letting you learn words directly in their natural context. A-contextual, rote learning is neither optimal nor necessary. Glossari will be an alternative to less stimulating, less effective methods of vocabulary building. 

âœ¨ Features
1. Contextual Definition on Demand: Select any word on a webpage, and Vocab Anchor will provide its definition, clearly showing it within the original sentence or phrase where it appeared. Understand meaning and usage instantly.

2. Intelligent Text Selection: Our extension efficiently identifies and extracts the exact word you highlight, along with its surrounding sentence for rich contextual understanding.

3. One-Click Anki Flashcard Creation: Automatically generate Anki flashcards from the selected word, its definition, the original context sentence, and its translation. This pushes new vocabulary directly into your spaced repetition system.

4. Seamless Integration: Designed to work smoothly across various webpages, making learning an integral part of your browsing experience.
